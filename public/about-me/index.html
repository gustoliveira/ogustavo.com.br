<p>Hello! I&rsquo;m Gustavo =)</p>
<p>I’m a <strong>Software Engineer</strong> working based in Salvador Bahia, Brazil. I work as Mobile Developer at Oxeanbits and I’m Computer Science Student at UFBA.</p>
<p>My programming journey started in 2017 during High School. I was in a Scientific Initiation project and was necessary to create a small automation program with Arduino and it was love at first sight. The project didn’t worked well, but those nights where I was trying to create the script changed my life.</p>
<p>I suffer for Palmeiras and love to watch sports, mainly football, basketball, and Formula 1. Also love listen to Musics and watch Movies, although I don’t consider myself a cinephile, those late 90’ korean movies hit different.</p>

<h4 class="firm-title" id="oxeanbits-2021---current">Oxeanbits (2021 - Current)</h4>
<p>Currently participating in two different projects:</p>
<p><strong>- Digitalize</strong></p>
<p>Contributed to the conception, design and development of a B2B mobile and desktop application used to manage and control processes and perform analyses for various companies with an extremely customizable architecture.
Worked primarily on the frontend, which uses Flutter and MVC architecture, with Redux and GetIt for state management, integration with native Android functions such as GPS, camera and gallery. Creation of screens and components that respect the layout provided in Figma.
Also performed tasks on the backend, which uses the Ruby on Rails framework, MongoDB database, and provides an API in the GraphQl architecture. I was also responsible for automating the publication on the Google Play Store using Fastlane.</p>
<p><strong>- DPMS</strong></p>
<p>Project developed for a multinational company. Participated in the frontend, made with JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS that communicated through a REST API, also made with Ruby on Rails. But most participated in the mobile application made in Kotlin using Redux and ObjectBox.</p>
<p>Both projects use Git for code versioning, a complete pull request process, and code review on GitHub to ensure that all generated code is clean, simple, and readable, following Uncle Bob&rsquo;s clean code best practices. It is also mandatory to write tests for all contributions, which led to a coverage of 98%. Test verification is done automatically with a CI/CD pipeline from Drone.</p>
